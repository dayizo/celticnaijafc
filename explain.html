      <p>
        As you have made it to this <span class="small">EXPLANATION</span> page,
        you have made the first and most important step in using compund
        interest formula, which is <span class="big">UNDERSTANDING</span>. I
        will keep it simple and precise!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What is <span class="big">COMPOUNDING</span>?
        <br />
        Compounding describes the process where investment returns themselves
        generate future gains. The value of an investment can increase
        exponentially(i.e bigger every time) because growth is earned on both
        the initial sum of money plus the accumulated wealth.
        <br />
        <br />
        I said I'd keep it <span class="small">simple</span> yea? Here's the
        simple part...
        <br />
        <br />
        No analogies, no given instances... Your investment is your stake, and
        returns are your winnings. Getting growth on both stake and winnings is
        <span class="big">COMPOUNDING</span>

        <br />
        <br />

        Here at <span class="small">Celtic Naija FC</span> we have started the
        compounding journey with 500/-. Kind of small right? Yes! But that's the
        idea... why start with a lot when the aim is to grow!

        <br />
        <br />
        Our strategy is simply staking 20% of our total amount on predictions
        with little odds (1.5 - 1.7) that have the most chance of happening.
        This way, we stand a chance of going on a long run before encountering a
        loss (Yes, there will be losses)

        <br />
        <br />
        The more we win, the more our total sum increase, hence, our 20% stake
        and hence our returns(winnings). This is a slow and steady growth that
        requires <span class="small">MAXIMUM</span> patience and
        <span class="big">zero</span> greed.

          Type in your daily interest rate in percentage as 50. This is so
          because 1.5 odds is 50%. If you stake 1000/- on 1.5 odds you get
          1500/-. The addition being 500/- is 50% of the original
          investment/stake.

          Select 20% as your reinvest rate. This is the key to our strategy as
          we do not want to loose all of our deposit upon a loss. If you have a
          deposit on a larg side (say 10000/-), I strongly advice you make that
          reinvestrate be at 10% and increase your number of successful stakes.
          We will provide odds for you continuously.

          Here we see the exponential growth of our initial deposit. Insane
          right? Yea! Here, 80 business days stands for 80 successful stakes. We
          will not be staking everyday as we only target best case scenarios and
          "sure" events. These don't come everyday. Hence, the need for
          <span class="small">patience</span> and the abscence of
          <span class="big">greed</span>.
