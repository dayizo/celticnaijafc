          <p>
            Lovely how this streak kicks off 2/2. We are hopeful to maintain an
            8/10 win ratio. Although we know that no events are sure. But from
            records, we see that taking the smallest odds with the most
            likelyhood of happening reduces the chances of loss a lot. Some
            events like the u3.5 in this slip did exceedingly well and one may
            be tempted to wish it was an u2.5 but no, that is where greed comes
            in. We look forward to the next event. Stay tuned!

            As we can see here, the games are carefully picked with worst case
            scenario in mind. Although there were to scares, but in the end
            fortune was on our side and we me! Note that only 20% of my deposit
            was at stake. This is in accordance to the compounding rule we set
            for ourselves. For more information on said rule, click
